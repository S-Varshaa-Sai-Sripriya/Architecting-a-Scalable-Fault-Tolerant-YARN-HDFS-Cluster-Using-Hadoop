The idea is to develop a robust, distributed data processing infrastructure via a two-node CloudLab topology. The core deliverable is the provisioning and configuration of a high-availability Apache Hadoop 2.7.2 cluster, integrating HDFS for durable data storage and YARN for scalable resource management. Key architectural tasks include implementing passwordless SSH for secure, automated node communication, fine-tuning HDFS replication for optimal performance, and deploying a Fair Scheduler to ensure equitable resource allocation across multiple queues, minimizing latency and maximizing cluster utilization. This project validates a production-ready blueprint for internal big data environments.
